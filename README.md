# supermarket_data_analysis
Through this project, I identified the most popular product lines,  preferred customer payment methods, and the distribution of sales across different branches and customer types. These insights can be invaluable for businesses looking to optimize inventory, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer service.
# Supermarket Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project that explores a supermarket sales dataset to uncover meaningful insights and trends. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to delve into the supermarket sales data and extract valuable insights that can help businesses make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer service. The analysis covers various aspects of the data, including:

* **Sales distribution across different branches**
* **Customer ratings and satisfaction**
* **Gross income per day and gender**
* **Popular product lines**
* **Preferred payment methods**

## Key Findings

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

* **Branch A in Yangon consistently outperforms other branches.**
* **Customer satisfaction remains relatively consistent throughout the week.**
* **Tuesdays and Saturdays generate the highest gross income.**
* **"Health and beauty" and "Electronic accessories" generally receive higher ratings.**

## Files

* **supermarket_sales.csv:** The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* **supermarket_sales_analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.
* **rating chart.html:**  HTML file of an interactive Plotly chart showing ratings per day of the week.


## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
